# Kotlin Demo Null Safety

Null safety is a feature in Kotlin that aims to prevent null pointer exceptions, which are common errors in many programming languages.

In Kotlin, every variable and object reference has a type, and that type can be either nullable or non-nullable. A nullable type can hold a value or a special value called null, which means that the variable doesn't point to any object. On the other hand, a non-nullable type can only hold a value and cannot be null.
